Alright.

I know what I want to do.

And there are a LOT of ways to do it.

Which one is right for my needs?

Time/Space  Impatient/Patient
Doom/Life Calm/Energetic
Rage/Hope Realism/Idealism
Void/Light Accepting/Curious
Breath/Blood Free/Committed
Heart/Mind Introversion/Extroversion

~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary of Problem: (Five minutes on the Clock).

I want to take 6 stats, each of which could be positive or negative, and convert
that into a Begining, Middle, and End for the trolls.

If at all possible, I want to avoid randomness.

If at all possible, I want there to be a satisfying connection between Epilogue and stats.

SubProblems: I think it will be more complex than flags, because 12 possible stats.

((future jr, look into land theme stuff possibly for this, but no solution now).

What other parts of this problem exist?

I need to keep the text BRIEF, no risk of it going off screen.

Do I want lusii selection to be based on stats? Lusii actions?

Case of death. Yes. If they die younger than lifespan, it was a violent or sickly one.

I think each part of the problem needs to turn into sub problems, Begining, Middle, End.

I don't want to drill down too much into details right if I'm on the clock.

Think.

I anticipate that it will still LOOK somewhat random, unless I focus hard on making things work.

What about stat interactions? (the land idea from earlier???)?   An impatient, energetic wiggler vs a patient energetic wiggler?

I don't want this to be TOO involved, but I do want there to be a satisfying correlation.

There's that word again: satisfying. I want stats to mean something because the epilogue is the
last permanent thing you get for the wiggler. It has to be THEM, frozen in time.

Also: will raw stats matter or only pos vs neg? Thresholds?

Alright. Only 20 seconds left. That's good enough for time.

~~~~~~~~~~~

So, before I started summarizing the problem, I was tempted to try to roll a solution right now, with only
my single test stat added. I realize now that it will make me too dependant on independant stat values, which I don't want.

So:

Action Items:

*  Add 5 more stats.
* Stats have thresholds for low, medium, high, and VERY HIGH values. Don't print raw numbers any more.
    * Grubs are born with low/medium stats. High and VERY HIGH will be from raising.
*  Make a Begining Use case for how lusii and lusii actions will matter (maybe only actions?).

Possible thought: Pick two things for middle and begining based on highest and second highest abs value stats?

But then it would be too consistent.

Weight each stat based on comparison to VERY_HIGH, pick from array?
have begining, middle and end stored in stat itself. Remove stat from array if you pick it for a section, so you can't
spam it?

Would make creating the stat a bit more ponderous, but I don't mind. It's like the land thing wihtout
being as involved as the half-thought I had during problem definition.

Yes. This is my plan.  Stat has the thing that goes in the template when it says lusii did x and y and troll did x and y.
template itself is random.
b,m,e arrays, and copies for jade, fuscia, and purple

((Also, I'm realizing that by doing it this way (game play coded last, endings coded first),
I'm sort of giving people goals to work towards. First they see the endings, then they get
the tools to raise their wiggler towards desired endings and find new ones.


~~~~~~~~

Okay, I have some infrastructure in place.

I might not be able to think straight enough (shit is stressful irl) to do anything with teh infrastucture.

What needs to happen?

When I create a Stat, i should pass a positive and negative flavor.

That's first . I don't have to think more than that many steps ahead.

~~~~~~

Alright that's done.

What's the next step?

For each stat in the stats array, ask it to add whatever flavor is appropriate at the right weight to
a weighted array.

Then, add the default values at a low weight. .1 or whatever.

So. What is the right weight?

I want some things to essentially be zero weight, right?

Maybe not.

So, Use Case:

I have HIGH PATIENCE.

I ask the stat to add itself to my existing array of flavor text.

It says "my value is positive", so it uses positiveFlavor and not negativeFlavor

Then, it says "am I higher or equal to low?", the answer is "yes", so it adds all "low" values.
Then it says the same for medium, which is YES, high, which is YES and VERY HIGH which is "no".

So the only one it doesn't add is VERY HIGH. Weights it adds it at is based on which tier it is.

Now, since the DEFAULT flavor thing isn't attached to a stat, the stat itself can't have the logic.

The stat will pass a number to it and the "am I higher or equal to X" logic happens on the passed number.

If it's default, the number you pass in is the average abs value of all stats.

~~~

Alright, I think I have the infrastructure.

Now what needs to call it?

I guess I'll approach it from the opposite angle? I need to unhook old middle text and use this one instead.

Different templates.

~~~~~

Alright. It's not time for bed yet. So what's left?  Non-Natural causes of death of course.

What I need to do is have some stats marked as "increase chance of violent death". And some be neutral, and some case it.

Then add up stats and use that as a random roll for if they die early or not.

THEN pick a random number between 1 and their expected lifespand and that's their new lifespan.

THEN ask a stat what hte cause of death is. (random list???)

~~~~

Morning: Any stat? No only stats that increase chance of violent death..

What stats would that be?


    static StatFlavor defaultFlavor;
    static StatFlavor patienceFlavor;
    static StatFlavor energeticFlavor;
    static StatFlavor idealisticFlavor;
    static StatFlavor curiousFlavor;
    static StatFlavor loyalFlavor;
    static StatFlavor externalFlavor;
    static StatFlavor impatienceFlavor;
    static StatFlavor calmFlavor;
    static StatFlavor realisticFlavor;
    static StatFlavor acceptingFlavor;
    static StatFlavor freeFlavor;
    static StatFlavor internalFlavor;


    Things that reduce risk of early death:

    patient, calm, accepting  ((less because alternia was dangerous))

    things that increase rick of early death:

    , curious, impatient, idealistic,loyal,curious

    internal/external , energetic,realistic don't effect it either way?

    So what kind of endings do   curious, impatient, idealistic,loyal, free ,

    cause?

    "asking the wrong questions","trying to rise in the ranks too quickly", "fighting for their ideals","defending the Empire from rebels", "rebelling against the empire"


also special death text for Fuchsias (no others). Fuchsias are special cases in general, likely to die very early
violently.

~~~

alright, what do I need to do next?

I guess go at it from the other end, what is currently happening on death?

int lifeSpan =  rand.nextInt(max - min) + min;
        int numberOfSweeps = lifeSpan;


So, once I get the lifeSpan i should calculate if i die early
(dif alg for heiresses). If I do, pick a stat randomly from my list of
stats, weighted by comparison of that stat to high (and default is in there, too)

~~~
Now, how to do fuchsia?

Normally it will be "generate a number between 0 and 2x lifepsan, if it's lifepsan or longer, assume natural death"

but the heiresses have this HUGE chance of dying early, then less likely later on.

So. What?

assume max lifespan is "100*2". If it's 100 or bigger, they win their challenge?



~~~~~

Okay, time for the last thing I need to hook up, otherwise known as the biggest thing.

//based on stats
String getCauseOfDeath() {
    return "FIGURE THIS OUT ASSHOLE";
}


Alright so, loop on stats, for each stat, add the stat's flavor (it auto gets positive vs negative).

To add the flavor, loop on the stat's flavors death flavor, the weight you add it at is your stats percent thingy.

then, add default at .01 or whatever.

OR would it be better to try to add the weight at the stat flavor's weight?

how did I do regular middle text flavor anyways? i already fogotet

~~~~~~

oh shit, oh fuck, i forgot to weight shith by liklihood of violent death, like an asshole, it's just random

Also everything is a natural death righ tnow.


Alright.

So I have a method violentDeathString that takes in how long they lived and uses their stats to get "cause of death";

but i forgot to have the method that needs to call that.

It's just
String regularEnding(int maxLife) {
        //TODO
        throw("todo");
    }

For heiresses i just generated a random number between 5 and maxlifespan * 2 and that's
all well and good, they are special.

BUT, for regular trolls....what to do?

I know i have some infrastructure set up:

each statflavor takes in a poistive, negative or neutral number.

Do I still want it to work that way?

So let's get a usecase out:

Impatient: Low, so 1.0
Energetic: Medium
Idealistic: Medium, so 1.0
Accepting: Low so -3.0
Free-Spirited: Low, so 1.0
Internal: Low


I should probably multiply by weight in StatFlavor, so:

LOWWEIGHT = 0.5, MediumWeight = 1.0

1.0* 0.5 + 1.0 * 1.0 + -3.0*0.5 + 1.0 * 0.5

Total odds of a violent death = 0.5 + 1.0 - 1.5 + 0.5 = 0.5

So what do I do with this number?

generate random number between -1 and violent death chance (if negative death chance skip).

if number is positive, violent death?

OR, could separate it out a bit, cuz -1 was arbitrary.

instead of:
1.0* 0.5 + 1.0 * 1.0 + -3.0*0.5 + 1.0 * 0.5

arguments for = : 1.0* 0.5 + 1.0 * 1.0  + 1.0 * 0.5
arguments against = : -3.0*0.5

generate a number between -1.5 and 2.5.   If it's positive, violent death.

Yes, I like this.

~~~~~~~
Okay. Next thing that happens is me assigning signs.

Several things will need to happen.

ONE, I need to figure out what their highest normalizedStat is. (pick it at random between ties).

Then (for now) pick a lunar sway at random. LATER it will be based on the care you give them, maybe.

THEN I need to know how to associate all 288 signs.

Might wanna flat out make it an object system.

Like, have a caste object, and each caste has a owned lunar sway object and THAT has only 12 signs.

So, first I say "I am a bronze blood" and pass a random fucking lunar sway.

The bronze object goes to the chosen lunar sway and then asks the passed in troll
what it's highest stat is.   From there, it returns the img_num needed to render the right sign.

OR.....

Could approach this based on the object I already have.

Go through the stat directly.

Ask the troll "what's your highest stat, if more than one, pick one at random"
then, go to the stat itself and pass in lunar sway (random) and blood color word
and it knows how to turn that into a number.

that requires no new objects, but IS a bit less intuitive for distributing img numbers

With the other system I can just be store min and max numbers for castes,
with the stat based system it would be more:

huh. what WOULD it be?

on the extended zodiac grid it's diagonal.....

Actually...this is a good point.


I don't need to store just signs associated with a caste, i need to know
which is time+derse vs time + prospit.


Okay.   288 signs as specific objects?

Static variables that let me filter by caste, lunarsway and aspect.

THERE we go.

It will be a fucking chore setting them up. But. I can do it.


~~~~~~

Okay, I have 100% of burgundy set up. Before I get any further, it's time to experiment:

can i filter all signs by caste, aspect, moon?

And once I do, can i assign it to the troll and have it be rendered?

Just hard code the troll to be burgundy even if they aren't.

THEN, once I know it's hooked up, can procede to fill in other castes.

nvm, found  a helper. thanks 'I am cat.As yet, I am firerachet' -



~~~~~~~

Alright here we fucking go: time to brainstorm the actual AI.

    Stat patience;
    Stat energetic;
    Stat idealistic;
    Stat curious;
    Stat loyal;
    Stat external;

So, I want to come up with actions the wigglers can do,
and how the decision to take an action is mediated by their stats.

What do I have to work with?

I want there to be AI Pets and AIObjects? So that no matter what I'm interacting with
I can have the same code.

So Use Case.

A grub interacts with an AIObject.  The grub changes it's own state, and the
AIObject changes it's state (possibly not at all if it's inanimate).

Without trying to get too far into the code, let's try to imagine general things that the stats could be
related to.


Stat external;
    If it's high, they investigate their surroundings, if low, they space out.
Stat curious;
    This feels kind of similar to external/internal? Maybe it's how far they are willing to go to find new things?
    How likely they are to just walk around for no reason?
Stat energetic;
    How fast they move?
Stat patience;
    How long they interact with the same thing? (but how diff is this gonna be from loyal)

I'm noticing that plenty of stats seem similar when it comes to actions (but maybe not reactions).

So maybe...

Loyal/Patient = how long you interact with the same object
External/Curious = how far you're willing to walk to get to an object
Energetic/Idealistic = how fast you move (wide eyed wonder makes you fast?)


So what about reactions? Or maybe it'd be more accurate to call them interaction styles?
No, because loyal/patient involve inveractions hrrrm....

Could come up with something else for them?


But let's think about reaction.

Use Case:

Player tosses a Smuppet into the playpen.

Curious grub goes up to investigate it. Once it's there....what happens and why?

Well, obviously objects should have stats.

But what does that mean?

Hrrrrm.

I want to say "loyal" grubs like items that match their stats the best, but that's putting the cart ahead of the four wheel device.

Alright.

Boil this shit down to it's base component. Grubs face expresions aren't going to change because
barring some weird jarring swaps, there's too much variability.

So.

A grub investigates a smuppet. A HEART appears over their head.
An OLDER GRUB with gold eyes investigates the smuppet. They say "Wike this!" over their head. Or "Good!".

So this means I'll need an "EMOTION" object which has an icon, and a list of random associated phases.
All grubs have baby talk quirks, but not necessarily the same one?

An emotion should take in a grub and decide whether to use ICON or WORDS.

So what emotions are there?

heart
spade
club
diamond

happy
surprised
calm
sad
angry
scared


What will trigger each emotion?

Well. What exists?

Should I give the grubs memory? (may as well, i have as much save data as I need).

So:

I have:

Grub
    stats
    list of items seen before (includes grubs)

Other Object (which could be a grub)
    stats


So, I need to have a  method that decides if I am positive or negative about an object,
and another method to decide what positive or negative means for that grub in particular
(will it be scared, angry, etc).

judgeObject takes in an object, and is a method on AIPet.
    First it judges how similar the object is to me.
    Then it decides whether similarity is a good or bad thing.

    THEN it checks the grubs memory to see if it's seen that object before
        (item name or stat match, both work, so it means you like familiar things even if you
        haven't seen that exact thing before)

    Then it decides whether familiarity is a good or bad thing.




Alright now, let's talk about emotions.

heart
spade
club
diamond
happy
surprised
calm
sad
angry
scared

I need to figure out what the bare minimum emotions I need are and how they relate to stats.
Obvs quadrant symbols are only going to be for other grubs.

But let's see if the existing stats have a particular lens for their emotions.

Time/Space  Impatient/Patient
Doom/Life Calm/Energetic
Rage/Hope Realism/Idealism
Void/Light Accepting/Curious
Breath/Blood Free-Spirited/Loyal
Heart/Mind Internal/External

Patient/Calm/Realistic: + CALM
Energetic/Idealistc/Impatient: +EXCITED
Curious/Free/Internal: - SCARED
Idealistic/Energetic/Impatient: - ANGRY
Curious/Free/Internal: + SURPRISED
CALM/Patient/Accepting -SAD
Curious/External/Free-Spirited - BORED

Happy and Bored can be defaults if you aren't leaning in a particular direction?

Okay well, I already have the quadrant symbols, so let's test with those first.


~~~~~~
Alright, between a lot of bullshit I had to abandon the playpen for several days in a row.

Now I need to come back to and figure out where I left off.

....Bluh I hate getting interupted. It's like I have to manually kick start the obsession back up.

Looks like I was just testing being able to render an emote at all.

I know I have some quadrant symbols set up, where are they?

The important thing is getting all the foundation layers set up. Once I do that I can REALLY make progress
as I come up with ways to remix it and shit.

Alright, looks like AIPet already has some emoticons set up.

Do they know how to render themselves?  Should be relative to their grub.

I need to setEmotion before I do anything else though... should do that in controller.

In my head, I want the emotion popups to bob a bit before being dismissed. I'm not sure how willing I
am to do this right vs fast though.

~~~~~~
Implementing items.

Test Case:

In controller, create a test item with three names, and three sprites, stats.

Add to playpen.

This causes it to be rendered somewhere randomly (but on the ground).

All wigglers react (no matter where they are).

Then, work on wiggler walk animations.
Wigglers notice, investigate if they choose to.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alright.

I need to concentrate.

I have no other thing I can do right now except ....

Wait even without internet I can use my phone to check typo fixes and bug reports. Okay

I'll do that first. Get my chill.

~~~~~~~~

Okay. that was less typos and bug reports than I hoped.

I know it's hard to think right now.

But I need to code so I can get my chill back.

So.

~~~~~~~~~~


GOAL:   Wigglers need to be able to choose when they walk around vs sit and do nothing.

Triggers for walking:

I'm gonna try to ramble rather than bullet points, I don't have a solid idea on this one.


Basically, I want only ITEMS to give their stats to a wiggler, but for a wiggler to be able to
investigate other wigglers or ITEMS.

If they investigate another wiggler, they respond with a QUADRANT SYMBOL.

If they investigate an ITEM they are GIVEN THE ITEM which is already coded and has them react and also get stats.

So, step one is to code a GIVE WIGGLER function. It should assign a quadrant symbol based on likesSimilar and
likesFamiliar. Right? except I don't want wigglers to have IDs. So no familiarity with other wigglers.

It should also call the GIVE WIGGLER function on the target with a "don't recurse" type of flag.

I need to test this on the test page.  Give all wigglers first wiggler and see how they react.

Then, i can call it on the animated page.
At that point I'll need to have a "emotions only last x frames" fucntion.

~~~~

Alright, coded wigglers reacting to each other, now to test via button.

~~~~

Alright tested.

What now?

I want to write a method that has a grub ask the playpen if any grubs are near the grub.

Or....no, not quite that.

Grub asks playpen "what other objects are there?" then the grub asks each object where it is and decides
if it's close enough to try to walk to.

(curious grubs will basically have the entire field as "true" for investigation))

once a list of valid targets (eeeeeyyyy is this a refrance? ) are compiled, the grub
will pick one at random and head to it.

Once you have a target you ignore everything else till you reach it.



Independant of target picking, grubs need to be able to say "I am X close to an object, i should react to it", even
if it's not their target.

THAT means I need an AI loop independant of frame rate?

for now have it just be frame rate and decide later if that matters.


v1 of emotions will have "if you are not near an object, do not have an emotion"
and "have the emotion so long as you are near it".

FORSEEN PROBLEM: if a grub gets stat boosts every time it is in a frame next to an object
shit will get OP fast.

How can I fix this?

Could have objects vanish when used? But then unfair because you might want grub X
to get the boost but they aren't curious/energetic enough?  ((valid point, since items are currently
deployed randomly, should uncurious grubs have a random chance of checking something out anyways if nothing is in their queue?))

I got distracted. Okay, well, easy fix is all grubs in playpen are given the item's stats on deploys, but don't
react until they get close to it.


Alright, that's been a lot of rambling, but what are my action items?

*  on give item give stats, but don't react (make new method for give stats).
*  in same as draw loop, playpen passes each pet a list of the other pets and items in the playpen in AITICK.
*  each pet uses curiosity to get a list of things it wants to investigate
*  picks one thing to investigate, sets it as "target". display "?" or "!" emotion.
*  if already has target, don't pick new target in next AITICK
*  whether target or not, if item or grub falls within RADIUS of grub, react.
*  walk towards target with "walk" animation and x position changing based on ENERGETIC QUOTIENT

so, first, make a method for giving list of objects.

next, make a method for picking a new target (if no current target exists).

once target is picked, test changing animation and moving towards target (flip correctly, too)


~~~~~~~~

Well that's one way to lose your train of thought. IRL Shit intensifies in a bad way.

But doing this helps me focus, so let's go.

I've tested that picking a target is now a thing that can happen.

I need to now translate a target into a direction I should be walking.

~~~~~~~~~~~

Alright. The AI is ALMOST done.

I need to figure out the last little bit.

They do not always face the correct direction, and sometimes they walk off in a direction no other grub is.

Let's simplify the problem. get rid of two grubs.

AHAH: I think I see it. it's not enough that they turn turnways if they need to go left, they also need
to UN turn turnways if they need to go right. derp.

~~~~~
Alright, that just means I have the "wiggler suddenly sprints off screen" problem.

I'm assuming it's either a target problem ( are they targeting themselves somehow?) or a direction
problem (are they going the wrong way to get to their target?)

I've got some logs where Novice Nitche sprints off screen.

target for Novice Nietzsche is Master Pooplord
VM88:1 drawing playpen

Master Pooplord is in the left half of the screen, near the purple grub.
it prints out 'Novice Nietzsche needs to go left.'

Novice runs to the right.

WHY.

~~~~~~~

Alright. The boredom update is nearly ready.

EXCEPT the surprise noodles are never showing. Why? Is it because there's too many grubs?

Alright.
Riddle me this batman: when it's just two, even if they are on opposite sides of the screen,
they say their quadrant shit before moving due to boredom, instead of saying ?.

WHY.

Pupate second grub, what happens if only one grub?

they say "null".

then, when they get there, they say their bored phrase (which is because it's imaginary).

Then they sit there with no text for a bit.

Then, when they leave, they say their bored phrase AGAIN.

Why?

This is so insane. Emotions shouldn't cache?

Is it the emotion caching...or the canvas?

......................

oh my fucking god.

I'm caching the emotion's text.

and i'm doing currentEmotion = surpriseNoodle
instead of setting it directly.

so fucking dumb.

fix for this is making it private with no setter.

~~~~~~

No discord till i get the shop done or lunch happens.

Current bug: items aren't even CALLING their version method?

(my goal is for one item to have several forms based on it's average stats).

~~~~~~~

Okay, I've got some sample items created.

FIRST STEP: have an AI item know how to render itself into html (not canvas).

includes a "purchase" or "deploy" button and a list of it's stats. (ignoring zero stat ones).

Render these items unto the stat page.

~~~~~~~~

Alright, now for the HARD part.

I need to get the itemInventory to save itself to JSON, and load as well.

Once I do that I can make the "buy" button work
and display my inventory on the playpen page (under the playpen itself)

~~~~~~~

Alright, the store is WORKING, except when I reload the page it's not storing how many items I have.

So. Is it a save issue. Or a load issue.

First, check saving:

AHAH i bet i'm just straight up never saving. I need to be saving after each purchase.

alright, now there's an error on load.

~~~~~~
....................
................
.........
.....
.

What
The
Actual
Fuck.

Items are saving and loading, 10/10. Except hte player's inventory has MULTIPLE carrots, for example
but only the first one renders........
because the ImageElement isn't being copied because omfg.

Wait. that can't be true. The copying is happening on another page.

So what IS happening?

There is no img tag in there. Hrrrm.

wait not it's the last one that has it.

bluh. Why is that?

(also it's a buy button when it should be a deploy button)

oh.

AHAH:

        imageElement = await Loader.getResource(("$folder$chosen"));
 but what i need to do is make a copy of it. not use the cached one hte loader has.


 ~~~~~~

 alright, deployed items aren't attracting as much attention as hoped.
 I think i need to dial down the boredom rates.


 ~~~~~

 Stats are wrong. Giving them even one carrot makes them INSANELY high. why?

 ~~~~~~

 Alright, now grubs are flipping their shit about items and refusing to ever stop from reacting to the. WHY.

well, to make it easier to test i coul dmake it so curious grubs always investigate new items.

~~~~~~~~~~~

Current Sequence of Events:

Fresh Screen.
Toggle Animations.
Deploy Carrot.
Wiggler reacts to carrot.
Wiggler spends a split second wanting to investigate carrot.
Wiggler decides carrot is close enough to react to.
Wiggler no longer has a target.

When wiggler finally does try to go see the carrot, it never thinks it reaches it.
starts raving.


Since I am making wigglers target new items, no more auto react. Turn that off, see if it helps.

.....
No matter where the carrot spawns. It thinks it's at distance "2";
What happens if I spawn the carrot in a set location?


........

It's rendering half way across the map but thinks it's x is zero.


.......

WTH.

Okay.

"place on ground" is called once it renders. until then x is zero. instead, i should make
x default to something that can  never be accidentally triggered.
-100013 perhaps?


~~~~~~

Alright, let's fucking go.

Today I need to implement currency.  money will be a field on player directly,
and i want the navbar to both display current currency and a button for collecting daily amounts
(and a timer counting down to next amount).

anything that updates money doesn't do so directly, wrapped in method that updates navbar.

buying grubs costs money based on stats and caste.
buying items costs money based on stats.
graduating a grub gets money based on stats and caste.


~~~~~~

Alright. Slow and steady. Focus. I'm running out of time but I'm ALSO running out of features.

I can do this.

I even canceled my IRl friday hangout so I could do this.

First thing I need to do is fix the bug where it lets you buy multiple of an item even if you'd run out of money.

It happens because the button only validates on creation, but after other shit.

disable and change class if at any point the button is clicked but shouldn't be? good enough for now.


I can feel a headache coming on. Luckily I'm going to break for dinner soon.

~~~~~~


Next up: I need to make it so that if you go to ANY page (besides your data) without any grubs, it redirects
you to the adopt page.

Then, I need to make a loading/auto play for playpen.

THEN I can take my victory lap and do the fun stuff of making Empresses effect the sim.

~~~~~

First thought:

Just make stop = false and see what htat breaks.

if it breaks NOTHING and just looks bad,
have it display "Loading" until it loads.

~~~~~~~

Alright, today I'm finally going to tackle pagination. Should be simple enough.

The alumni screen is way too long.

Want a section for "Total Alumni: 347" or whatever.
Want to be able to pick 6, 12, 24, 48, or 96 alumni per page.

Then, (stretch goal, maybe do after next page) want to be able search for text in the epilogue page
and display up to that many results at a time.

ALSO want to have a page listing the extended zodiac table, with it greyed out if you don't have it.
If you click, shows all the alumni matching that sign you have.

Same for diff page with aspect/moon.

I remember I did Pagination for MonGirlTile so.... what was the basic algorithm? probably involves modulo.

		for(int i = (page*cards_on_page); i<((page*cards_on_page) + cards_on_page); i++){

oh that's p simple. Okay.

For now just put this logic in a controller?

~~~~~

Alright, so what do I want for the sign page.

First step is just to display ALL the signs, in the right order.

Second step is to.... Hrrrm. Grey out the ones you don't have?

Third step is to make clicking it take you to the alumni page, but with a modifier to only display
trolls with that sign.

Then i'm done?

So. How do i get to that first step?

I have all the signs, just uncolored. I....REALLY do not want to make 244 canvases on a screen, even if they are tiny?
Wait, what am I talking about, that's just what I do for loras.
Alright, this is easy.

So how big should they be? How big are they on the extended zodiac page of what pumpkins?

Looks like about 50 by 50.

What are signs like right now in my system, like....the objects? Do they know how to render themselves?

        new Sign(Sign.BURGUNDY, Sign.TIME, Sign.DERSE);
and then they auto get assigned a sign number via:

        imgNum = Sign.signNumber;

So, I assume it will be organized different from the what pumpkin page. it will be all burgundy then all bronze.
that will probalby be fine for now.

What next?

Well, i got the number, so I can just go into /Homestuck/CanonSymbols and draw it.

How will I know what color to make it? probably something in HomestuckTrollDoll...


Hrrrm.... maybe not. Doesn't seem like it has any functions for that.

Alright then, I have a todo:

1: Render the uncolored 244 troll signs in order, each row is a color.
2: Make the signs the correct color (modify the doll code to have a funciton for this)
3: See how long it takes to render.
4: see if i can make each column a color instead
5: color bgs black or grey based on whether or not i have at least one alumni with that sign
6: click on canvas to go to alumni view of all trolls of that sign.
7: click on row/column to go to alumni view of all trolls of that caste.
8: epilogue search in alumni view

~~~

oh fuck
i forgot the canon symbols are stored.
with.
it positioned for a doll.
do i really trust the auto crop algorithm to both work, and be 244 fast?

no.
i have the cards somewhere, right? could work?




yeah, just fucking do that, won't need to recolor anyways. just resize

~~
Okay how far along am I?

5: color bgs black or grey based on whether or not i have at least one alumni with that sign
6: click on canvas to go to alumni view of all trolls of that sign.
7: click on row/column to go to alumni view of all trolls of that caste.
8: epilogue search in alumni view


so next step is being able to say "of all the alumni, how many are sign X".
and then i need to make alumni controller take in a param to filter by that (get?)

go find that "where" syntax

bug: wiggler eyes keep going to yell......
huh.

am i saving wigglers before i am asking about mutant eyes?

i'm not, am i.

god damn.

that was a fast fix.

hrrrm. no. i am.

so.

a saved grub might load with wrong eyes anyways?
time to hack my save data to test this hypothethis

seems to be confirmed.

i recall that i change the eyes to "yellow" when they are old enough? that might be it


~~~~~~~~~~

alright i've found an obvious sign bug.

bronze prospit heart is ending up hope instead.  and the other troll with that sign is REALISITC and not ideaslistic.

it's confusing.


~~~~~~~~~

Okay. I'm not making any progress and I feel like I'm just spinning in circles.

Five minutes, on the clock:

Define the problem:

Sometimes wigglers pupate and the signs they get don't match their stats. If I ask them to
recalculate their signs, it always matches their stats the second time.

When I'm watching, when I have the alumni not auto send us to the goodbye page, it seems to always fit.

Signs are created manually (someone helped me do it and past JR didn't write down who, which is bullshit,
pastJR fucked up). I added a debug statement when i click a sign and so far it's claimed
traits always match it's visible traits (caste, lunar sway, aspect).

Signs are assigned via caste, aspect, and a random coin toss.

If I ask a troll what' it's highest stat is to calculate it's aspect, it seems to always be right.

Investigate: does the sign somehow change on the goodbye page?

shit.

My stats are [Patient: Low (17), Calm: Medium (26), Idealistic: Medium (32), Curious: Low (4), Loyal: Medium (37), Internal: Medium (29)] and i think my highest is [Loyal: Medium (37)]
(program):1 My caste is Bronze, my aspect is BLOOD and my lunary sway is PROSPIT.  I picked sign 35

I could have sworn that was an impatient troll. ............

oh shit, i look at the troll page and i see:

impatient 43, calm 13, idealistic 14, curios 11, loyal 23, external 39.

What is going on.........

fuck.

am i.... calculating my sign before I'm getting my stats from my wiggler self?

oh fuck.

yup.

change pet into other pet makes a new Troll...and THEN changes it's stats to match the current troll
fucking HELL.


~~~~~~

the edna bug has been defeated. it's now the next day, and i need to figure out the sign bug.

basically, some grubs, when pupated, completely rerandomize, to the point of keeping
their blood color but having a completely different sign.

i tested convertOneDollToAnother in doll lib and it works as expected...though...the bodies are randomizing
and i don't know why

one weird thing, which might be nothing is:

original:

BodyOld: 53
HairOld: 13
HairOld: 13
LeftEye: 22
RightEye: 22
Mouth: 13
Symbol: 0
Glasses: 0
Glasses2: 0
LeftHornOld: 24
RightHornOld: 24
Fin: 0
Fin: 0
Wings: 0
CanonSymbol: 132
FacePaint: 0
Body: 53
Hair: 13
Hair: 13
LeftHorn: 24


grub:
Body: 0
HairOld: 13
HairOld: 13
LeftEye: 22
RightEye: 22
Mouth: 13
Symbol: 0
Glasses: 0
Glasses2: 0
LeftHornOld: 24
RightHornOld: 24
Fin: 0
Fin: 0
Wings: 0
CanonSymbol: 132
FacePaint: 0
Body: 1
Hair: 13
Hair: 13
LeftHorn: 24
RightHorn: 24

i.e. there's no 'body old', just two bodies and i don't know why

i'm gonna fiddle with wigglers and see if i can reproduce things.

so far no reproducition, but my cheat mode isn't given me the blood colors i expect and that's weird



cheating to get multiple of this caste. template is 0 and I am 0.
(program):1 sign is 0
(program):1 cheating to get multiple of this caste. template is 0 and I am 0.

it shouldn't be zero. it should be the right sign.

I don't understand. The eggs are all drawn the right color. But they aren't the right invisible signs.

What is going on?

is this important?  i know before it worked. so.........

hrm.

something is printing out signs and they are all different. what gives? who is printing it out?
doesn't seem to be me, so must be the doll lib

yeah, it's the grub doll:

if(sign != null) {
            print("sign is $sign");
            canonSymbol.imgNumber = sign;
            //makes sure palette is sign appropriate
            randomize(false);
}

so... hrm. what's going on after that? (i worry that i'm fixing A bug but not the bug i want,
but this is definitely important and related to signs)


used sign to set canon Symbol to 224
VM841:1 choose blood #631db4
VM841:1 after randomize, canon symbol is 0

...
...
...

Alright then. Seems pretty clear something is broken in randomize

oh yup, false alarm. i'm manually settting the sign to zero so that
the sign doesn't render. derp. alright. now what.

that means the easter egg never worekd. time to fix.


~~~~~~

alright the current bug i'm trying to fix is that on pupation, the grubs body (which is locked to be 0 or 1)
determines the trolls body. this is dumb as fuck.

and also..... I'm not sure why it wasn't happening before. Because I convert a grub to a troll
and all that does is copy over literally everything. This is conf....

Oh. Huh.  The edna mode bug was because it was using the image path and not the layer name.

that would have treated a grub body different from a troll body, and they wouldn't have overridden.

fair enough, re randomize the body on pupation and call it a day.

I want to be able to return facts about your save data for the caretaker rambling:

   String get mostCommonCaste {

    }

    List<String> get completedCastes {

    }



So....I guess first thing I do is figure out how the signs page works.

List<Troll> alumniWithSign(int signNumber) {
       // static Iterable<SBURBClass> get canon => _classes.values.where((SBURBClass c) => c.isCanon);
        Iterable<Troll> tmp = alumni.where((Troll t) {
            //sign is stored in doll.
            HomestuckTrollDoll d = t.doll as HomestuckTrollDoll;
            return d.canonSymbol.imgNumber == signNumber;
        });
        return new List<Troll>.from(tmp);

    }


    I'm just doing it by numbers....hrrrm.

    So how do i know about caste?

    okay, alumniWithCaste lets me know what your favorite caste is....

    but what about sign progress?

        static List<Sign> get completedSigns {
there we go

    static bool isCasteComplete(String caste, List<Sign> signs) {


that should be all i need.
